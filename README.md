This repository contains two IoT projects:

Real-Time Temperature Monitoring System A system to track and display temperature/humidity data using sensors (e.g., DHT11/DHT22) and Firebase for real-time updates. Includes a web dashboard for visualization. Smart Home Automation Prototype A proof-of-concept for automating home appliances (lights, fans) based on sensor data. Integrates IoT devices (e.g., ESP32) with Firebase for remote control.
